Hello fellow doctoral student,

Even though it is good to start early on, it can be difficult to actually begin writing the thesis. To help fellow doctoral students to get over this initial bump, I've shared a template for a cs doctoral student thesis. Its usable for both a kappa (compilation thesis) and monograph. I got this one from other doctorate students and cleaned it so its easily usable by new doctoral students. 

The classes and style folders contain the files necessary for giving the right shape to the document. From the classes folder only csthesis is used, but the other classes may be useful when you create a paper or a summary.

The papers folder is relevant if you make a kappa, which is a summary of your work followed by a  compilation of papers.

For printing services at Umea University, as of now 2024, it should be possible to just provide them with the pdf. This thesis style provides a pdf with size a5 ready to be printed.

Remember, every PhD thesis is unique, so probably some chapters need to be added or removed dependent on your requirements. Good luck with writing, I know its a lot of work but you can do it!

Best wishes,
Maarten Jensen
